        <p class="mb-1"> I am studying for a B.S. in Game Programming with a minor in Mathematics at the Champlain College. I expect to graduate in Spring, 2023. I've been coding since my sophomore year of high school and have had a passion for it ever since. I've found quite a lot of enjoyment from video game development and I hope to continue to create fun experiences for people around the world. </p>

        <p class="mb-1">Outside of coding I'm an casual hiker and enjoy a good swim on a hot day or just any day I can get to a lake or pool. I love to read comic books and enjoy building Lego sets. Tabletop RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons and Starfinder are one of the ways I like to spend my evenings, especially when I get to do it while sitting around a table with friends.</p>
